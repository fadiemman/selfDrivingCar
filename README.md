# selfDrivingCar
Take off to create a neural network using JavaScript. Discover how to build an entirely new self-driving car simulation, including everything from collision detection to auto mechanics. Understand more about artificial neural networks and watch how they function. By the end, you will have developed sophisticated self-driving car simulations and mastered the implementation of neural networks. Come along for the ride as we explore the exciting world of automation powered by neural networks.
The code is divided into parts as follows:

1. Car driving mechanics
2. Road definition
3. Artificial sensors
4. Collision detection
5. Traffic simulation
6. Neural network
7. Visualizing neural networks
8. Optimizing neural networks
9. Fine-tuning
10. Live stream variant
